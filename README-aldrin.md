## My process

### Preparation

- Setting up a github repository for the project to track my progress and learnings.
  1. Creation of the repository in Github
  2. Initiation of the local folder in Git
  3. Connecting the local folder to the repository in Github for synchronization.
  4. Update the github repository upon changes in the local files. 

### Built with

- HTML 
- CSS

### What I learned

- Application of google fonts
  1. go to fonts.google.com
  2. choose the font for the design based on the style guide or customer requirement
  3. either download or copy the link for the font.
  4. applying the font on the html by pasting the code below on the `head` tag
     
     ```
     <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
     <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
     <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
     ```
- adding in the font and connecting it with the style.css and also to activate as in the code below:
  
  ```
  * {
      font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  }
  ```
  
  this will apply to the whole page since I used the * as the selector.
- there are many ways to implement the design and it will depend on how I will be manipulating the HTML elements to style them using CSS.

### Continued development

- To compare my solution to other `frontendmentor.io` users and learn from their codes.
  - Update the solution with the following:
    - [ ] shadow of the container
    - [ ] adding media query for mobile views
    - [ ] improving the footer area
- To continue creating websites from the frontend mentor and understand the different techniques to create the websites.
