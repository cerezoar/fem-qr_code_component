## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Preparation
- Setting up a github repository for the project to track my progress and learnings.
  1. Creation of the repository in Github
  2. Initiation of the local folder in Git
  3. Connecting the local folder to the repository in Github for synchronization.
  4. Update the github repository upon changes in the local files. 

### Built with

- HTML 
- CSS

### What I learned

- Applying font from google fonts.
  1. go to fonts.google.com
  2. choose the font for the design based on the style guide or customer requirement
  3. either download or copy the link for the font.
  4. applying the font on the html by pasting the code below on the `head` tag
  ```
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  ```   
- adding in the font and connecting it with the style.css and also to activate as in the code below:
  ```
  * {
      font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  }
  ```
  this will apply to the whole page since I used the * as the selector.
